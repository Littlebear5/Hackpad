A hackpad for [Hack Club's Highway to Undercity](https://github.com/hackclub/highway) This pad has cut, copy, paste, tab left, tab right and alt tab buttons for more efficient work, especially when looking at stuff of the internet.

Ive never made custom PCB or programmed a keyboard before, so I had to learm most everything on the fly, but I had I good time and have now found out that this is something I can do as a hobby.
